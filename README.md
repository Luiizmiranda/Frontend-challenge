# üß† About

Throughout the challenge, I used styled-components to create styled components, providing a modular and reusable design to the project, along with the provided GraphQL API integration. Through this API, I implemented a product catalog with pagination functionality. This allowed users to view products on different pages, providing a pleasant browsing experience.
In addition, I implemented filtering by category and search by name features, allowing users to find products efficiently and accurately. With the functionality to add and remove products from the cart, I ensured that users could select and customize their shopping experience.

Finally, I developed a complete checkout page where users can review their selected products and complete their purchase. This page is essential for a seamless and intuitive shopping experience.
